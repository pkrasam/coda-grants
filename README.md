![Project Grant Program](https://github.com/CodaProtocol/coda-grants/blob/master/static/img/coda-grants-header.png)

The Project Grant program is designed to encourage community members to work on projects related to developing the Coda protocol and community. About $2.1M USD in Coda token grants has been allocated to support these efforts prior to Coda’s mainnet launch. There will be additional Coda token grants allocated after mainnet.

## Completed and current grant projects
Block Explorer
- Contributor: [Bitfly](https://www.bitfly.at/)
- Link: http://coda.bitfly.at/
- Description: An open source Coda block explorer that provides aggregated data about the Coda network and enables the users to view transactions, blocks, and accounts.  
- Repo: https://github.com/gobitfly/coda-explorer

Staking Explorer
- Contributor: [Figment Network](https://www.figment.network)
- Type: Open source
- Figment’s Hubble provides a block producers viewer, transactions viewer, account viewer, alerts for block producers and Snarketplace dashboard for the Coda protocol blockchain.    

Coda Gateway 
- Contributor: [Figment Network](https://www.figment.network)
- Type: Open source
- Provide a set of API’s that enable Gateway access for signing transactions, Transaction Search, Staking, and much more without running your own node. 

Block Producer Performance Dashboard 
- Contributor: [dsrv labs](https://www.dsrvlabs.com/)

The dashboard will present information such as memory & CPU, # of snarks added, # of sold snarks as % of added snarks that were sold, uptime %, snarker fees, and many other metrics.

Tokenomics Simulator
- Contributor: [Gauntlet Network](https://gauntlet.network/)
- A robust statistical model of Coda protocol economics, which will consist of a Python representation of key protocol logic, running on Gauntlet’s simulation cluster as well as agent and market models.

## About Coda

Coda is a cryptocurrency protocol that leverages zk-SNARKs to effectively compress the blockchain. Participants in the protocol can generate proofs that historical blockchain states were valid, and use the SNARK proof as a replacement for storing all the blockchain data. This effectively reduces the size of the blockchain to that of a couple tweets.

O(1) Labs is currently developing Coda as a completely open-source protocol, and serves as the current steward of the project. As such, community support and ownership of the protocol is not only encouraged but desired. The Coda Grants program is just the first of many initiatives to democratize the development and growth of Coda.

For any questions regarding the program, email grants[at]o1labs[dot]org.
